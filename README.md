# Solitaire RL
Small attempt to use RL to play the game of Klondike Solitaire.

This repositiory was created in the context of a final project for MATH231: The Mathematics and Statistics of Gambling.

The solitaire simulator in this repo is based off of Surya Dutta's (https://github.com/suryadutta/solitaire) implementation of the game, with a few twists.
